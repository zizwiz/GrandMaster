# GrandMaster
An app of many utilities to help with the understanding of how to code each one.
This app was started as a way to help understand certain parts of coding. When I have been stuck on a large project and need to find out how to do something or how to make something work, then instead of recompiling the whole project all the time I will add a small subproject this one and then work out how it works before I transfer the code back into the project I was stuck in. Over time I would create many small apps to learn something but then I would forget where I put it or what I called it. To make it easy for me to find again when I need it next time I put them all now under one large project. This akes this project a good help line.

At the moment this is very much in its infancy and a lot more work will be done to make it more slick. One major item that needs to be added is the front UI that will then link through to teh subprojects. I am workign on this at the same time as the other projects so it will take time to get it where I would like it to be so that adding a new project is automatically reflected on teh main UI with a short exlplanation of what it does.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

At this time nothing other than the code files are required to get up and running. 

### Installing

All the items are packed into one .exe file. When you run it for the first time the exe will create all the files it requires. If you have already run the program then it will not overwrite any of the files.

## Running the tests

At this stage there are no automated tests, this is still to be worked on.


## Deployment

All the items are packed into one .exe file. When you run it for the first time the exe will create all the files it requires. If you have already run the program then it will not overwrite any of the files.
